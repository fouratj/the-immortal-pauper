Ten years have passed since the forty-eight hours that transformed human civilization. We call it the Kaelen Event now, though the identity behind that name remains one of history's most protected secrets. What we know is this: on April 18th, 2050, humanity's first immortal died by assassination during his resurrection ceremony, and within forty-eight hours, the global patent system collapsed, artificial scarcity ended, and abundance became the natural state of human affairs.

I am Dr. Elena Vasquez, and I have spent the last three years collecting firsthand accounts from those who lived through the transformation. The testimonies you will hear come from survivors, witnesses, beneficiaries, and victims of what economists now call the Great Liberation. Some spoke to me willingly. Others required considerable persuasion. One insisted on complete anonymity, their identity so sensitive that even I don't know their true name.

The world today bears little resemblance to 2050. Medicine costs what it costs to manufacture. Housing prices reflect construction and materials, nothing more. Knowledge flows freely, unencumbered by artificial monopolies. The care work that sustains civilization—raising children, tending the elderly, maintaining communities—is finally recognized and rewarded by algorithmic systems that measure genuine contribution rather than rent extraction.

But this abundance was not inevitable. It was engineered, executed with surgical precision by someone who understood that markets could be leveraged to do revolutionary work, rather than just collect profit. The genius of the Kaelen Event was not destruction but redirection: making rent-seeking economically obsolete through superior alternatives.

What follows are fragments from the archive—incomplete accounts of complete transformation. I present them not as definitive history but as human testimony to the moment when artificial scarcity died and the species began to optimize for abundance rather than competition over manufactured shortage.

The first document comes not from an interview but from archived footage, reconstructed from security cameras, official transcripts, and witness accounts. It captures the apex of human technological achievement: the moment Damon Korr became the first person in history to conquer death itself.

It was also, as we now know, the moment his nephew chose to kill him.

Before we begin, I should note that Mr. Korr agreed to be interviewed for this project during his third resurrection, in 2058. His testimony, which you will hear following the ceremony reconstruction, was given with full knowledge of its historical significance. When asked why he chose to participate, he said simply: "Someone should understand what I couldn't see."

The ceremony footage has been restored to full resolution. What you are about to witness is the pinnacle of human ambition—and its necessary end.
